Tree Traversal :
1. BFS (Breadth First Search)
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadthward motion.
It visits all the vertices at the same level before moving on to the next level.
BFS is often used to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
It utilizes a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to be visited.


2. DFS (Depth First Search)
Depth-First Search (DFS) is another graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in depthward motion.
It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
DFS is often used to search for paths in a graph and to explore connected components.
It uses either recursion or an explicit stack data structure to keep track of the nodes to be visited.
